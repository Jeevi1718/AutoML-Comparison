# AutoML-Comparison
Comparison of various AutoML Frameworks such as H2O AutoML,PyCaret..

#Notebooks
This project brings together a set of notebooks where I explored and compared different AutoML frameworks. The idea is to see how various tools perform, how easy they are to use, and what kind of results they can give when applied to the same problem.

Copy_of_AutoML_Project.ipynb → A general set of experiments comparing multiple AutoML approaches.

AutoMLPycarrot.ipynb → Experiments and results using the PyCaret library.

Manual_of_AutoML.ipynb → A manual approach to training models (to compare against automated methods).
